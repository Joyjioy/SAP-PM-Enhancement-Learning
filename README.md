# ABAP SAP Enhancement Learning

A local learning environment for studying SAP PM enhancement using realistic business cases, mock databases, and ABAP implementations.

The repository is designed to simulate how business requirements evolve into technical implementations without requiring access to an SAP system.

---

# Objectives

This repository was created to:

- Learn ABAP by implementing real maintenance business rules.
- Understand how SAP PM objects are related.
- Practice translating business requirements into program logic.
- Build a personal playground for studying Enhancement development.
- Document the evolution of a maintenance program from simple requirements to more complete business processes.

The focus of this repository is **business logic**, not SAP installation or system configuration.

# Learning Flow

The repository is intended to be studied in the following order.

```text
Fundamentals

↓

Understand the Mock Database

↓

Read the Business Requirement

↓

Analyze the Business Logic

↓

Study the ABAP Implementation
```

Following this order helps connect SAP business processes with their corresponding ABAP implementation.

---

# Mock Database

The repository includes a small maintenance database that simulates several SAP PM objects.

| Object | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Equipment | Master data of plant equipment |
| Functional Location | Equipment installation location |
| Notification | Maintenance notification |
| Work Order | Maintenance work order |
| Permit | Work permit information |
| Employee | Personnel information |
| History | Maintenance history |

The mock database is intentionally simplified to support learning and does not represent the complete SAP PM data model.

---

# Case Studies

Each case represents an enhancement request from the maintenance department.

Rather than creating independent programs, every case extends the previous business process.

| Case | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Case 01 | Automatically create Notification |
| Case 02 | Prevent duplicate Notification |
| Case 03 | Validate Running Hour |
| Case 04 | Validate Permit |
| Case 05 | Automatically create Work Order |
| Case 06 | Final enhancement integrating previous business rules |

This approach reflects how maintenance systems are typically enhanced over time.

---

# Scope
